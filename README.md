Insights dashboards are a great way to provide context and meaning into your userâ€™s data.  However, most insights dashboards are separate from the transaction data.  A user must navigate away from their current work areas to the Insights dashboards.

Beginning with PeopleTools 8.61, we can embed Insights dashboards in to Related Content, Fluid pages and Fluid Work Centers.  We can now meet the user where they are at in their workflow and provide an Insights dashboard their pages besides their data.
